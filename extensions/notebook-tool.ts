/**
 * Notebook toolkit for the tutoring session.
 *
 * Gives the tutor agent small, high-level tools (nb_add_cell, nb_edit_cell,
 * nb_delete_cell, nb_read, nb_run) instead of raw bash + marimo code-mode
 * boilerplate. The extension generates the `cm` ceremony itself, which:
 *   - cuts token usage (the model sends only the cell body),
 *   - removes a whole class of errors observed in real sessions:
 *       cold kernel (cells never run)      -> warm-up call before every op
 *       redundant mo/nx/np/plt imports     -> stripped automatically
 *       editing a nonexistent cell         -> pre-check, returns cell list
 *   - keeps the student's terminal quiet: each call renders as one friendly
 *     status line ("📝 Setting up your first question…") with output hidden
 *     behind the expand keybinding. The LLM still receives full output.
 *
 * Upload boxes carry a 📨 Send to my tutor button: pressing it appends to
 * session_artifacts/student_signal.txt, which the watcher below turns into a
 * turn, so the tutor never has to ask whether the photo is up. Everything
 * else the student explores (sliders, widgets) has no button — they say so
 * in the terminal and the tutor reads the values with nb_read.

 * the r/f prefix from the ORIGINAL source token — so a note created as
 * `mo.md("…\\frac…")` is written back as a NON-raw `mo.md("""…\frac…""")`,
 * and the next reload lets Python eat `\f`, `\a`, `\r`, `\t`. That is how
 * the module's central definition ended up on screen as
 * `C_i = rac{ ext{friendships…}}`, and $L = 7/6 pprox 1.17$ beside it.
 * Every note skeleton is full of LaTeX, so this hit the keepsake hardest.
 *
 * A raw string cannot contain `"""` and cannot end in a backslash, so the
 * text is split into raw chunks glued together with ordinary literals. In
 * the normal case (no triple quote anywhere) that is exactly the
 * `r"""…"""` marimo writes for itself.
 *
 * The prefix marimo copies is the LAST string token's, so that token must be
 * raw no matter what the text ends with — and a note ends with the student's
 * own words, which can perfectly well end in a quotation mark. Padding the
 * final chunk with one newline (invisible in markdown) keeps it raw instead

  // The student stares at "Working…" during model calls, notebook round-trips

  // dead air becomes a tiny extra lesson.
  //
  // HARD RULE — these lines are shown at random, so any one of them can land
  // while any checkpoint is open, in ANY module that installs this toolkit.
  // One list serves them all, so it must be clear of every module's answers.
  //
  // Small-world (m02): no hop count for Milgram or Facebook (cp1), no "put
  // the cable across the ring" (cp4), no friendship/triangle counts (cp3,
  // cp5), no "clustering stays while distance collapses" mechanism (cp6), and
  // no "high clustering AND short paths" definition (cp5_tension, cp7).
  //
  // Königsberg (m01): no degree counts and no "two ends per edge, so the
  // total is even" (cp2_degree), nothing about distances or sizes being
  // irrelevant (cp2_abstraction), no odd-node rule and no 0-or-2 condition
  // (cp3_parity, cp3_verdict), nothing about what the 1944 raid did to the
  // answer (cp3_bombing), no connectivity clause (cp4_disconnected,
  // cp6_redteam), and no indptr rule (cp5_csr). This module is the reason
  // three of the lines below were rewritten: "geometry with the distances
  // thrown away" is cp2_abstraction's gold answer in six words, "the puzzle's
  // answer changed with them" is cp3_bombing's, and the handshake fact is the
  // hint cp2_degree's teaching moment turns on. Context and history are fine;
  // answers are not.
  //
  // And a line that says "this module" must be true in every module it can
  // appear in. One claimed Karinthy asked the question behind "this whole
  // module" — true next door, and simply false to a student reading about
  // Euler.
  //
  // A NAME is an answer too. cp3_global_clustering asks the student what to
  // call a trio with all three friendships present, and a tip reading "that's
  // where triangles come from" handed the word over while the question was
  // open — it cleared the count rule above and still lost the checkpoint. If
  // a checkpoint asks "what would you call…", the word it wants is banned
  // here as firmly as any number.
  // Scoped by module. One flat list served every module, and an m01 student
  // counting bridges was told "that 1998 Nature paper is three pages long" —
  // about a paper nothing in their session had mentioned — along with karate
  // clubs, Milgram's letters and C. elegans. None of it leaked an answer; all
  // of it was orphaned, and half of it primes the NEXT module's subject in a
  // course whose own rule is to point backward and never forward. Two live
  // probes filed it independently.
  //
  // GENERAL is what survives anywhere: it may not depend on anything a
  // particular module introduced, and it may not use "that"/"his"/"the famous
  // result" to point at something the student has not met.
